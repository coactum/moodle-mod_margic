# Margic #

## Description ##

This plugin allows users to make various entries and teachers to rate and annotate these entries.

This plugin is based on the official mod_diary Moodle plugin (v. 3.4.1) from AL Rachels (https://moodle.org/plugins/mod_diary) which itself is a fork of the mod_journal plugin (https://moodle.org/plugins/mod_journal). The original plugin code was widely rewritten in the making of this plugin.

The plugin also incorporates JavaScript Code from the Hypothesis project (https://github.com/hypothesis/client) which is released under the 2-Clause BSD License (https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause), sometimes referred to as the "Simplified BSD License".

It also uses JavaScript Code form the approx-string-match-js project (https://github.com/robertknight/approx-string-match-js) by Robert Knight wich is released under the MIT License (https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
